# @love-moon/ai-sdk

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 8e1d4a8: Prefer the bundled Copilot platform executable before the JS entrypoint so Node
  20 installs do not fail with `ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE: node:sqlite`.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 4e8d4e5: Include `CHANGELOG.md` in published npm tarballs.

  The `files` array in each package's `package.json` previously only
  listed the build output (`bin`/`src` for the CLI, `dist` for the
  modules). npm's `files` whitelist replaces the default include set,
  and CHANGELOG is not one of the auto-included files (only
  `package.json`, `README*`, `LICENSE*`, and `main` are unconditional).

  As a result, every release through 0.3.0 published tarballs with no
  CHANGELOG, so a consumer running `npm install` or unpacking the brew
  artifact had no way to see what changed in the version they just
  installed. The repo `cli/CHANGELOG.md` and the GitHub Release body
  remain the canonical source until 0.3.1 ships with this fix.
